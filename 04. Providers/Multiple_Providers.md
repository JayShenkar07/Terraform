# Infrastructure creation on multiple providers using Terraform

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1" 
  # Considering you've configured aws cli
}

provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "your-azure-subscription-id"
  client_id = "your-azure-client-id"
  client_secret = "your-azure-client-secret"
  tenant_id = "your-azure-tenant-id"
}
```
And by simply using the terraform documentation you can create resouces in multiple providers with their respective configurations

```
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name = "example-vm"
  location = "eastus"
  size = "Standard_A1"
  
}
```
